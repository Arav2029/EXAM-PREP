QN 30PGES--15QN

------------------

DB---RDS
Amazon Aurora
It’s only compatible with PostgreSQL/MySQL

It is only supported by regions which have minimum 3 availability zones.
● High availability of 99.99%. Data in Aurora is kept as 2 copies in each AZ
with a minimum 3 AZ’s making a total of 6 copies.
● It can have up to 15 Read replicas (RDS has only 5).
● It can scale up to 128 TB per database instance.
● Aurora DB cluster comprises two instances

PRIMARY DB INSTANCE---R/W
AURORRA REPLICA---R

-------------------------------------------------------
Amazon DocumentDB

It is compatible with MongoDB versions 3.6 and 4.0.
 DocumentDB storage scales automatically in increments of 10GB and
maximum up to 64TB.
● Provides up to 15 Read replicas with single-digit millisecond latency.
● All database instances are highly secure as they reside in VPCs which only
allow a given set of users to access through security group permissions.
● It supports role-based access control (RBAC).
● Minimum 6 read copies of data is created in 3 availability zones making
it fault-tolerant.
● Self-healing 
----------------------------------------------

Amazon DynamoDB---N RDS


AWS DynamoDB is a Key-value and DocumentDB database by Amazon.
● It delivers a single Digit millisecond Latency.
● It can handle 20 million requests per second and 10 trillion requests a day.
● It is a Serverless Service; it means no servers to manage


DynamoDB Accelerator
● Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed in-memory cache
engine designed for Amazon DynamoDB.
● It can deliver up to 10 times performance improvement and can handle
around 20 million requests per second.
● The performance can improve from milliseconds to microseconds.
● DAX is for the workloads that are read-intensive, not write-intensive. DAX is
not for strongly consistent reads.
-----------------------------------------------

Amazon ElastiCache

ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory data store for latency for high workload
It works with both Redis and
Memcached protocol based engines
