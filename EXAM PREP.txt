------------------

DB---RDS
Amazon Aurora
It’s only compatible with PostgreSQL/MySQL

It is only supported by regions which have minimum 3 availability zones.
● High availability of 99.99%. Data in Aurora is kept as 2 copies in each AZ
with a minimum 3 AZ’s making a total of 6 copies.
● It can have up to 15 Read replicas (RDS has only 5).
● It can scale up to 128 TB per database instance.
● Aurora DB cluster comprises two instances

PRIMARY DB INSTANCE---R/W
AURORRA REPLICA---R

-------------------------------------------------------
Amazon DocumentDB

It is compatible with MongoDB versions 3.6 and 4.0.
 DocumentDB storage scales automatically in increments of 10GB and
maximum up to 64TB.
● Provides up to 15 Read replicas with single-digit millisecond latency.
● All database instances are highly secure as they reside in VPCs which only
allow a given set of users to access through security group permissions.
● It supports role-based access control (RBAC).
● Minimum 6 read copies of data is created in 3 availability zones making
it fault-tolerant.
● Self-healing 
----------------------------------------------

Amazon DynamoDB---N RDS


AWS DynamoDB is a Key-value and DocumentDB database by Amazon.
● It delivers a single Digit millisecond Latency.
● It can handle 20 million requests per second and 10 trillion requests a day.
● It is a Serverless Service; it means no servers to manage


DynamoDB Accelerator
● Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed in-memory cache
engine designed for Amazon DynamoDB.
● It can deliver up to 10 times performance improvement and can handle
around 20 million requests per second.
● The performance can improve from milliseconds to microseconds.
● DAX is for the workloads that are read-intensive, not write-intensive. DAX is
not for strongly consistent reads.
-----------------------------------------------

Amazon ElastiCache

ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory data store for latency for high workload
It works with both Redis and
Memcached protocol based engines

Exam Preparation Tips & Tricks
Here I am listing the actual tips and tricks that would help you to pass this exam.
The following topics are mostly covered in the exam:
1. Compute
2. Cost management
3. Database
4. Disaster recovery
5. High availability
6. Management and governance
7. Microservices and component decoupling
8. Migration and data transfer
9. Networking, connectivity, and content delivery
10. Security
11. Serverless design principles
12. Storage


Important Tips:
1. Download study guide from AWS official site and go through each and every concepts. This makes you to 
remember the important concepts.
2. Start your AWS free tier or Sign-up with Whizlabs account to get the hands-on experience on AWS labs. 
Whizlabs providing 200+ free AWS hands-on labs.
3. While you are preparing for the exam, keep taking the notes and maintain them safely. These notes are 
important to revise just before the exam.
4. You have to imagine yourself as an architect and apply the contents using the AWS best practices and well 
architected framework.
5. AWS documentations and AWS FAQs are the most important part of your preparation. Keep reading them 
again and again to understand all the concepts.
6. Completely read the well architected framework where most of the questions would be asked from the design 
concepts.
7. Most of the questions may be asked around three-tier architecture like EC2, VPC, and databases so plan to 
study them how to use subnets, multi-AZ, security groups, NACL, ELB, Auto-scaling, etc for designing 
highly available, fault-tolerant, and secure systems.
8. Learn the concepts of :
1. AWS EKS
2. AWS ECS
3. AWS CloudTrail
4. AWS Config
9. Study all the AWS services which helps you to connect the on-premise systems to cloud systema

high performance and frequently------cluster placement in az,,,,,HA---spread placement
active passive failover---if primary db fails
scalble application---s3 with transfer accelerstion to host app
windows file server----fsx
decoupling(microservice)----sqs,,,,sns--pub sub model
real time---kinesis data streams,,,,,near real time----kinesis data firehose....analyse data---kimesis data anlaysis
regular interval----AS Schedulinh policy 
reads are causing high I/O----read replica

----------------------------------------------------------
part 2----198
CDN (block acess from  few cntries)----geo restriction form blocked countries
across muulti AZ----EFS and it can scale accordingly
aurora--endpoints,,,multi AZ db cluster,,also have 15 read replica(improve performance)
withstand loss of an instace,million transsacation -----ec2 instance store
static html page----s3,,,around the world ---cdn
lambda--unpredictive workload,dynmodb--key value pair
aws global acc----have static ip to map apllication acorss multi region to improve redudunacy
CROS---muliple aws region
gateway---s3 and dynmano db
--------------------------------------------------------

part 3


FSx for Lustre for high-performance parallel storage,,,s3 for clod storage
Amazon EC2 instances,deployed to a second Region-----AMI
A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, 
or AWS Direct Connect connection

Gateway endpoints -
A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined 
to a supported AWS service. The following AWS services are supported:
Amazon S3 -
DynamoDB

Amazon RDS MySQL database without encryption-----------ss

How do I encrypt Amazon RDS snapshots?
The following steps are applicable to Amazon RDS for MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or 
MariaDB.
Important: If you use Amazon Aurora, you can restore an unencrypted Aurora DB cluster snapshot to an 
encrypted Aurora DB cluster if you specify an AWS Key
Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key when you restore from the unencrypted DB cluster 
snapshot. For more information, see Limitations of Amazon
RDS Encrypted DB Instances.
Open the Amazon RDS console, and then choose Snapshots from the navigation pane.
Select the snapshot that you want to encrypt.
Under Snapshot Actions, choose Copy Snapshot.
Choose your Destination Region, and then enter your New DB Snapshot Identifier.
Change Enable Encryption to Yes.
Select your Master Key from the list, and then choose Copy Snapshot.
After the snapshot status is available, the Encrypted field will be True to indicate that the snapshot is 
encrypted.
You now have an encrypted snapshot of your DB. You can use this encrypted DB snapshot to restore the DB 
instance from the DB snapshot

CONTAINERS
Speed, Agility, require a lot of heavy lifting and for building pipelines
ECS
- Need to create task definition (Config like 1 or more con, CPU, memory, launch type, n/w type..)

Containers --> Task(1 or more con app) --> Services --> Cluster

ECS Agent
- For Control plane communication and control plane (Fully managed)
- Manages the containers
- Automated fleet of EC2 Instances

FARGATE
- Serverless way to manage the services
      Creating EC2 inst VM's, Join ECS cluster, check whether enough container details, Manage OS, Docker runtime, Full access of infrastructure.

EKS
- Manages KBS Cluster 
- Deploys and manages KBS master nodes
Control plane
* Worker node (Made of EC2 instances and Self-managed)
      Compute fleet
      EKS - Via KBS Worker processor
* Node group (Semi-managed)
      Create and delete EC2 instances- Configuration
* EKS with Fargate (Fully-managed)

ECR
- Repository for container images (Your app images stored here)
- Automatically notified (New image update)

Repo name --> Push in different image --> Endpoint to download EKS(or)ECS

FEATURES OF ECR
- Encrypted and compressed (15MB --> 6.2MB)
- Faster and agile when loading
- Reduce cost and it can also create lifecycle policy to use latest image
